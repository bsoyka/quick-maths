# Quick Math
Quick Math is a very simple program that allows anyone to answer simple multiplication questions.  Users are awarded points for answering questions correctly, and it is a different amount of points for each level.  You level up the first time by answering 5 points correctly, but then the time it takes to level up doubles every time you do it.  When you level up, the amount of points you get per correct answer also doubles.  If you get a question wong, your level starts over at 1 point and 5 questions to level up, and you lose 5 points from your score.
